    <div class="boxprojects">These are all of my projects that I have made throughout my time in Advanced Computer Science so far this year. So far there are not that many on my website because it is early in the year. As you can see I have made 2 projects so far. My first project was the duck and the raisin person in front of the American Flag. I simply put the American flag in the background and cropped out the background of the other two characters, and then inserted them on top of the flag. For my other projects, I added the background to my photo, then added the picture of the duck without the background, and then cropped the sunglasses to a size I liked and added some text.</div>
