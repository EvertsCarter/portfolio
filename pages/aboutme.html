    <h1 class="heading"> About Me!</h1>
    <div class="boxaboutme">My name is Carter Everts, I am 17 years old, and I am currently a senior in high school. In my free time I like to watch movies, and TV, and play video games. My favorite sports are football and baseball, and my favorite teams are the. Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Cubs. In the future, I hope to go to college and major in computer science or software engineering. I used to play football until I was a sophomore and then I dropped out because I wanted to get a job to pay for gas for my car, and also to start saving up for college. I currently work at a grocery store in the frozen department about 15 minutes away from my house.
