    <h1 class="heading"> Deep Thoughts!</h1>
<div class="boxdeepthoughts">This page is for when I have some deep thoughts that I want to write down. For example, if I have an epiphany about something, then it might make it onto this page. If I come up with a really good joke I might also put it on this page. If something happens to me that is worthy of a story than that might go on this page too. This page will most likely not have too much on it because I will only put deep thoughts on this page on special occasions. Many famous historical figures had deep thoughts that they shared with others, so I figured that I would share my deep thoughts with you.
