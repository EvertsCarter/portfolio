    <h1 class="heading"> Welcome To My Website!</h1>

  <div class="boxindex">Hello, and welcome to my website. In my website I have four different pages. My home page, my projects page, my deep thoughts page, and an abut me page. I edited this picture by putting an American flag in the background, and then I cropped out the background of the duck, and put it on top of the flag. Then I did the same thing for the raisin person and put that over the duck slightly. This is my first time creating a website, so it is still pretty basic. I hope that you enjoy what I have put together so far, and have a good day. </div>
